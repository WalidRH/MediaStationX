## Description
Media Station X is a cross-platform web application for creating customized media pages (consisting of videos, audio files, images, texts, and links).

Media Station X is designed to run on any TV device (e.g. smart TVs, set-top boxes, HDMI dongles, and HbbTV devices). However, it can also run on mobile and desktop devices, because it supports various input controls (e.g. remote controls, keyboards, mice, pointer and touch devices). The application itself does not contain any content and is a so-called White Label Application. You can either create your own content or open existing and shared content from other people. All content is written in JSON format -- See example above -- with a simple and easy-to-use structure. The created JSON files can be hosted on any HTTP server that supports CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
